## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-10

First stable, well-documented release.  The core detection algorithm has been
in continuous operation at N6OL since 2024-05-15.

### Added
- Comprehensive unit test suite (228 tests, 93 % line coverage) with
  deterministic synthetic-audio golden files that lock in DSP behavior.
- Python `logging` throughout — timestamped log lines replace bare `print()` calls.
- `pytest-cov` added to requirements; `pyproject.toml` enforces ≥ 90 % coverage.
- Ruff lint configuration in `pyproject.toml`; all lint errors resolved.
- Open-Meteo weather provider as an alternative to CumulusMX.
- Optional server-upload mode — set `[server] enabled = false` to run locally.

### Changed
- Configuration migrated from flat key-value to nested TOML sections
  (`[audio]`, `[station]`, `[weather]`, `[server]`).
- CSV column headers corrected: signal and noise floor now labelled `(dBm)`;
  SNR left unitless (it is a dimensionless ratio).
- `signals_adjusted` renamed `source_power_estimate` for clarity; removed from
  the dead `min_y` axis-scaling calculation.
- Extracted `_PULSE_WIDTH_SAMPLES = 3` constant; replaces all bare `3` literals
  in the DSP core.
- Extracted `_S9_DBM = -73` named constant (IARU reference level).
- `signals_adjusted` → `source_power_estimate` in plotter; clarified it is
  axis-scaling only, not a plotted series.
- Error and warning messages now follow context → problem → remedy structure.

### Fixed
- `generate_graph_from_csv` y-axis lower bound was accidentally including
  `source_power_estimate` in `min_y`, which had no effect (adjusted values
  are always ≥ originals) but was misleading.
- CSV parsing switched from manual `split(',')` to `csv.reader` to handle
  quoted fields correctly.

## [0.4.0] — 2025 (approximate)

### Added
- Full type annotations across all modules.
- Module-level and method docstrings throughout.
- `_bar_color()` helper extracted from inline comprehension in plotter.
- `zip(*[...])` sampling pattern in collector for cleaner multi-value averaging.

### Changed
- All internal-only methods renamed to `_private` convention.
- Daily graph layout fixed to exact 1600×640 px output with pixel-accurate margins.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2025 (approximate)

### Added
- Interactive audio device configurator (`configure.py`) with live signal-level
  display; writes device index and name into `~/.buzz/config.toml`.
- TOML configuration support (`tomllib` / `tomli`).
- Jinja2 HTML index template with per-minute auto-refresh.
- 23:59 no-refresh logic to avoid midnight page flip to an empty graph.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2024 (approximate)

### Added
- Numba JIT-compiled `_average_pulse_amplitude` for ~10× faster pulse summation.
- Pre-computed pulse kernel (built once at init, not per sample).
- `pulse_rate` config parameter — supports both 60 Hz (120 pps) and 50 Hz (100 pps) grids.
- Probability summary graphs: all-time, 7-day, 30-day.
- CumulusMX weather integration.
- SCP upload via Paramiko.

## [0.1.0] — 2024-05-15

Initial working implementation deployed at N6OL.

### Added
- FFT-based pulse-train correlation detector using `scipy.signal.fftconvolve`.
- Symmetric (palindrome) pulse kernel so convolution equals cross-correlation.
- Per-minute CSV logging with timestamp, SNR, signal, and noise floor.
- Daily signal-vs-noise-floor PNG plot with S9, threshold, and noise-floor
  reference lines.
- Mean-absolute-amplitude measurement (not RMS) — deliberately chosen for
  impulsive noise to avoid understating peak arc amplitude.
- Minimum-correlation phase used as noise reference to exclude arc bursts from
  the floor measurement.
